                            <span style={{fontWeight:"bold"}}> "SPE Cares"</span> by organising numerous <span style={{fontWeight:"bold"}}> Fundraising

                        <p>SPE AUACT Student Chapter feels glad to
                            have launched the <span style={{fontWeight:"bold"}}> "Foster A Tree"</span> initiative
                            under the banner of <span style={{fontWeight:"bold"}}> "SPE Green Campaign"</span>
                            thereby contributing to the sustenance of Earth's
                            biosphere. The Student Chapter Members are
                            encouraged to plant saplings in the places they
                            reside and are advised to adopt those unto its
                            lifespan. As deforestation has ramped up,
                            Earthâ€™s climate has changed significantly and a
                            global reforestation effort can have a gradual
                            climate mitigation impact. What happens to
                            Earth 100 years from Now depends on the
                            choices we make today!
